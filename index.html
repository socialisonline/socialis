<h3>A better digital future</h3><br>
<p>In a digital world, the young generations already have amazing computer skills from an early age. But how many of them know how to be competitive on the market and get the job of their dreams? How many of them are able to express their thoughts in a way that inspires others? How many of them know how to sell an idea and make a difference in this world? We understand how important it is to have marketing skills from an early age. The teenagers that learn today about marketing are the leaders and geniuses of tomorrow.</p><br>

<p>Socialis is an NGO that aims to educate the new generations of Moldova on digital marketing. Our main focus is on Email Marketing, Copywriting, Facebook Advertising and Website Development. Our mission is to create a community of ambitious young people, who wish to create a better future for Moldova and to ensure themselves a better future. We aim to ensure the young generationâ€™s qualitative education in the digital marketing domain and to ensure that they find a job that they enjoy and that satisfies them from the financial point of view.</p><br>

<p>In the Republic of Moldova, formal education does not include anything related to marketing abilities. We believe that each person needs to have them. This is why we have decided to build a community of young people that will have the chance to get high-quality and useful marketing knowledge, which is highly appreciated on the job market of our times.</p><br>

<p>We believe the most creative ideas come when people think outside the box. Our students will learn about critical thinking and will develop creative skills. Comfort with technology requires continued learning, as new developments are made. From using project management software to track the progress of a key campaign to using analytics to measure the success of social media campaigns, comfort with complicated suites of varying programs is required. We want to offer a friendly and productive environment, where every voice counts and every idea is listened to. Team work and development of social skills Small groups and more teachers, so that no one feels left behind. Last generation gadgets. We want to teach our students with the best available technologies possible..</p><br>
